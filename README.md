### Swing_Arm 
The goal of this project is to use the given drawinga and dimensions to create a swing arm in Onshape.

### Reflection 
The problem I had with this asignment was that the constraits were conflicted. I fixed this problem by drawing the rough sketch without any dimensions or constrains and then doing them at the end. 

### 4.1_Ring
The goal of this assignment was to create the ring for the spinner.

### Reflection 
I learned how to create a new variable and how to use it.

### 4.2_Key
The goal of this assignment was to create the key for the spinner.
