## Swing_Arm 
The goal of this project is to use the given drawing and dimensions to create a swing arm in Onshape.

This shows the dimensions of the swing arm.

This is the final swing arm, it includes multiple extrudes.

### Reflection 
The problem I had with this asignment was that the constraits were conflicted. I fixed this problem by drawing the rough sketch without any dimensions or constrains and then doing them at the end. 

## Ring
The goal of this assignment was to create the ring for the spinner.

### Reflection 
I learned how to create a new variable and how to use it.

## Key
The goal of this assignment was to create the key for the spinner.

### Reflection 
The instructions told us to make the Key a certain length but I would reccomend to make it longer.

## Assembly 
The goal of this assingment was to use that parts that we already built and assemble them together.

### Reflection 
I learned that when you are inserting hardware into a part you dont have to individually use mates and you can just select the 3 holes and then insert.

## Branch_and_Merge
The goal of this asignment was to create new branches and ver

![branch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71402974/197795208-2c2616d9-2cc8-47aa-a91b-cbae74ba838c.png)

This photo includes versions from Both me and Matthias including both of our spinner designs.

### Reflection 
I learned that you should use a branch when you want to create a independent workspace in the same document and a version is a snapshot in time.

## Multipart_Studio
We were given multiple drawings and dimentions to create a new part.

![multi part studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71402974/197798641-c9b8b33c-b5cc-4a04-92d6-027131d9cdf8.png)

This includes multiple parts including the Cylinder, top and bottom cap, plunger, plunger top, and bolts.

### Reflection
I learned that on the drawing if the dimensions are in parenthases then you should not have to manually put it in.
