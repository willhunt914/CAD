## Swing_Arm 
The goal of this project is to use the given drawing and dimensions to create a swing arm in Onshape.

This shows the dimensions of the swing arm.

This is the final swing arm, it includes multiple extrudes.

### Reflection 
The problem I had with this asignment was that the constraits were conflicted. I fixed this problem by drawing the rough sketch without any dimensions or constrains and then doing them at the end. 

## Ring
The goal of this assignment was to create the ring for the spinner.

### Reflection 
I learned how to create a new variable and how to use it.

## Key
The goal of this assignment was to create the key for the spinner.

![key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71402974/197542492-a5d48b14-5d41-4322-b4f4-9fb39dfefafb.png)

### Reflection 
The instructions told us to make the Key a certain length but I would reccomend to make it longer.
